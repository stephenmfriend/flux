> Flux is a **completely open, unopinionated task management engine**.

It doesn’t tell you how to work, who should do the work, or what should execute it.  
Flux simply tracks **what needs to be done** — and leaves everything else up to you.

- Create tasks manually, via APIs, MCP, or automation tools.  
- Execute them yourself, with AI agents, or through systems like n8n.  
- Close them by hand or programmatically.

Flux is just the **source of truth for tasks**.

Everything else is optional.

![Demo](./docs/demo.gif)

## Why Flux?

Most task systems tightly couple **tasks**, **workflows**, and **execution**.  
Flux deliberately separates them.

- Tasks live in Flux
- Execution happens anywhere
- Humans, agents, and automation all coexist
- No enforced process

If you want a rigid workflow, Flux isn’t for you.  
If you want **maximum flexibility**, it probably is.

## What Flux Is (and Is Not)

| ✅ **Flux *is*** | ❌ **Flux *is not*** |
|------------------|----------------------|
| 🔓 Open source and self-hosted | 📋 A project management methodology |
| 🔌 API-first | 🧱 A UI-heavy SaaS |
| 🔀 Execution-agnostic | 🤖 An AI platform that locks you into one model |
| 👥 Friendly to humans, AI agents, and automation | 🧠 A system that assumes how work should happen |
| 🧩 A stable foundation for any workflow | 🚧 A tool that forces process or structure |

## Features

- **Multi-project support** - Manage multiple Kanban boards
- **Epics and Tasks** - Organize work with epics (swimlanes) and tasks
- **Dependencies** - Track task/epic dependencies with blocked indicators
- **Drag and drop** - Move tasks between columns and epics
- **Search and filters** - Find tasks by text, filter by epic or blocked status
- **MCP Server** - Allow LLMs to manage your Kanban board via Model Context Protocol
- **Real-time updates** - SSE-powered live updates when data changes
- **Webhooks** - Push notifications to external services when events occur (Slack, GitHub, CI, etc.)

## Quick Start (Docker)

macOS/Linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sirsjg/flux/main/scripts/quickstart.sh | bash
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sirsjg/flux/main/scripts/quickstart.ps1 | iex
```

Then start the MCP:

```bash
docker run -i --rm -v flux-data:/app/packages/data flux-mcp
```

Web UI is [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Claude Code/Codex

Add the MCP server:

```bash
claude mcp add flux -- docker run -i --rm -v flux-data:/app/packages/data flux-mcp
```

To share the configuration with your team (creates `.mcp.json`):

```bash
claude mcp add --scope project flux -- docker run -i --rm -v flux-data:/app/packages/data flux-mcp
```

## Installation (Docker)

Docker is the recommended way to run Flux. Build the image first:

```bash
docker build -t flux-mcp .
```

### Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration file:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "flux": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "-v", "flux-data:/app/packages/data", "flux-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop after saving.

### Web Interface

Run the web server:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -v flux-data:/app/packages/data --name flux-web flux-mcp node packages/server/dist/index.js
```

Open http://localhost:3000

The web UI and MCP server share the same data volume, so changes made via Claude appear instantly in the web interface.

### Using a Local Directory for Data

To store data in a specific folder instead of a Docker volume:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/flux-data

# For Claude Desktop/Code config, use:
docker run -i --rm -v ~/flux-data:/app/packages/data flux-mcp

# For web UI:
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -v ~/flux-data:/app/packages/data --name flux-web flux-mcp node packages/server/dist/index.js
```

## Installation (From Source)

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 21+
- pnpm 10+

### Setup

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

### Running

```bash
pnpm --filter @flux/server start
```

Visit http://localhost:3000

### Development Mode

```bash
# Terminal 1: API server with hot reload
pnpm --filter @flux/server dev

# Terminal 2: Web dev server with HMR
pnpm --filter @flux/web dev
```

Web UI will be at http://localhost:5173 (proxies API to :3000)

### MCP with Local Install

Add to Claude Desktop (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "flux": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/flux/packages/mcp/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

For Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add flux -- node /path/to/flux/packages/mcp/dist/index.js
```

For Codex:

```bash
codex mcp add flux -- node /path/to/flux/packages/mcp/dist/index.js
```

## MCP Tools

| Tool | Description |

| `list_projects` | List all projects with stats |
| `create_project` | Create a new project |
| `update_project` | Update project details |
| `delete_project` | Delete a project and all its data |
| `list_epics` | List epics in a project |
| `create_epic` | Create a new epic |

| `delete_epic` | Delete an epic |
| `list_tasks` | List tasks (with optional filters) |
| `create_task` | Create a new task |
| `update_task` | Update task details/status/dependencies |
| `delete_task` | Delete a task |
| `move_task_status` | Quick status change (todo/doing/done) |

## MCP Resources

| URI | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `flux://projects` | All projects with stats |
| `flux://projects/:id` | Single project details |
| `flux://projects/:id/epics` | All epics in a project |
| `flux://projects/:id/tasks` | All tasks in a project |

## Project Structure

```
packages/
  shared/   - Shared types and store logic
  web/      - Preact frontend with DaisyUI
  server/   - Hono API server
  mcp/      - MCP server for LLM integration
```

## Data Storage

All data is stored in `packages/data/flux.sqlite`. This file is shared between the web UI and MCP server, so changes made via either interface are immediately visible in both. If `packages/data/flux.json` exists on first run, Flux imports it into SQLite and removes the JSON file.

## API Endpoints

| GET | `/api/webhooks/:id/deliveries` | Get delivery history |

## Webhooks

Webhooks allow Flux to push real-time notifications to external services when events occur. This makes Flux a great control center for automations like notifying Slack, creating GitHub issues, updating CI status, or triggering other workflows whenever work moves on the board.

### Managing Webhooks

**Via Web UI:** Click the "Webhooks" button in the navigation bar to access the webhook management page.

**Via MCP:** Use the `create_webhook`, `list_webhooks`, `update_webhook`, and `delete_webhook` tools.

**Via API:** Use the webhook REST endpoints listed above.

### Webhook Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `project.created` | A new project was created |
| `project.updated` | A project was updated |
| `project.deleted` | A project was deleted |
| `epic.created` | A new epic was created |
| `epic.updated` | An epic was updated |
| `epic.deleted` | An epic was deleted |
| `task.created` | A new task was created |
| `task.updated` | A task was updated |
| `task.deleted` | A task was deleted |
| `task.status_changed` | A task moved between columns (todo/in_progress/done) |
| `task.archived` | A task was archived |

### Webhook Payload

When an event occurs, Flux sends a POST request to your webhook URL with this JSON structure:

```json
{
  "event": "task.status_changed",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "webhook_id": "abc123",
  "data": {
    "task": {
      "id": "task123",
      "title": "Implement feature",
      "status": "done",
      "project_id": "proj456",
      "epic_id": "epic789",
      "notes": "...",
      "depends_on": []
    },
    "previous": {
      "status": "in_progress"
    }
  }
}
```

### Webhook Headers

Each webhook request includes these headers:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` |
| `User-Agent` | `Flux-Webhook/1.0` |
| `X-Flux-Event` | The event type (e.g., `task.created`) |
| `X-Flux-Delivery` | Unique webhook ID |
| `X-Flux-Timestamp` | ISO timestamp of the event |
| `X-Flux-Signature` | HMAC-SHA256 signature (if secret configured) |

### Signature Verification

If you configure a secret for your webhook, Flux will include an `X-Flux-Signature` header with each request. The signature is computed as:

```
sha256=HMAC-SHA256(secret, request_body)
```

Example verification in Node.js:

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifySignature(payload, signature, secret) {
  const expected = 'sha256=' + crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', secret)
    .update(payload)
    .digest('hex');
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(
    Buffer.from(signature),
    Buffer.from(expected)
  );
}
```

### Retry Behavior

If a webhook delivery fails (non-2xx response or network error), Flux will retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff:
- 1st retry: after 1 second
- 2nd retry: after 5 seconds
- 3rd retry: after 30 seconds

### Example: Slack Integration

Create a webhook to post task updates to Slack:

1. Create a Slack Incoming Webhook at https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks
2. In Flux, create a webhook with:
   - URL: Your Slack webhook URL
   - Events: `task.status_changed`
3. Create a simple proxy/transformer service, or use Slack Workflow Builder to format the message

### MCP Webhook Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list_webhooks` | List all configured webhooks |
| `create_webhook` | Create a new webhook |
| `update_webhook` | Update webhook configuration |
| `delete_webhook` | Delete a webhook |
| `list_webhook_deliveries` | View recent delivery attempts |

- **Build:** Vite, pnpm workspaces

## Roadmap

| Status | Feature | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| ✅ | Server-Sent Events (SSE) | Real-time updates for web while MCP is making changes |
| ✅ | Webhooks | Push task/epic/project events to other tools in real time |
| ✅ | Planning Phase | Add planning to Kanban for ideation phase |
| | Concurrency | Shared single-file SQLite is still a coordination point; concurrent writers are safer than JSON, but we may need conflict-aware merges for heavy multi-agent use |
| ✅ | Tests | Better coverage |
| ✅ | SQLite | Wire into storage abstraction instead of flat file |
