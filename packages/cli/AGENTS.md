## Flux Task Management

You have access to Flux for task management via MCP or CLI.

**Rules:**
- All work MUST belong to exactly one project_id
- Do NOT guess or invent a project_id
- Track all work as tasks; update status as you progress
- Close tasks immediately when complete

**Startup:**
1. List projects (`flux project list`)
2. Select or create ONE project
3. Confirm active project_id before any work

**If context is lost:** Re-list projects/tasks. Ask user if ambiguous.
